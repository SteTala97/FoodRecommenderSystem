# FoodRecommenderSystem
A very basic **recommender system** for **multimodal data** about food recipes. This is a project for the **Artificial Intelligence** course at **Universit√† degli Studi di Milano Bicocca** (a.a. 2021/2022).

The work was done by me and my classmate *Kevin Manella*.

The dataset we used, "*Food Ingredients and Recipes Dataset with Images*", is available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) website [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pes12017000148/food-ingredients-and-recipe-dataset-with-images)
